# Askebakken

This repository contains the source code of an app for the residents at Bofællesskabet Askebakken. It's currently WIP, but my intension is to:

1. Add a HotChocolate-based GraphQL server in .NET7
2. Add a React (or Vue.js) app that consumes the API

This repo has nothing to do with Bofællesskabet Askebakken's public website, https://askebakken.dk/, which is hosted elsewhere.

## Getting started

Coming soon.
